# Salesforce Modern Development Skill

## When to use

- Defining the next 6-18 month Salesforce roadmap.
- Deciding whether to introduce Agentforce or Data Cloud capabilities.
- Modernizing legacy orgs toward composable, event-driven architectures.
- Evaluating release-driven improvements for developer productivity.

## Instructions

1. Start with business outcomes, then map platform features.
2. Evaluate Agentforce usage where autonomous or semi-autonomous workflows create measurable value.
3. Use Data Cloud where cross-system data unification and real-time activation are needed.
4. Prefer event-driven integration patterns (Platform Events, CDC, pub/sub) over brittle point-to-point coupling.
5. Keep AI and automation features governed:
   - Role-based access.
   - Auditable execution paths.
   - Data classification and retention controls.
6. Modernize incrementally:
   - Pilot in one domain.
   - Capture metrics.
   - Expand after proving reliability and ROI.
7. Track release upgrades proactively and convert high-value platform enhancements into backlog items.

## Decision output template

- Opportunity statement.
- Platform capability mapping.
- Security/compliance impact.
- Delivery sequence (pilot -> scale).
- Success metrics and operating model.
